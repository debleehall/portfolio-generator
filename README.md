This application was used to teach Module 9 (Node.js). 

***Module 9 skills learned:***
* We understand the purpose of Node.js and some of its uses in web development.
* We know how to create and execute a Node.js application.
* We learned a bit about the process for new features to be introduced into JavaScript and who is in charge of it (Ecma).
* We can use new means of creating variables and functions in JavaScript.
* We know a new way to concatenate variable data into strings using template literals along with some other new ES6 features such as destructuring and spread/rest operators.
* We can modularize the Node.js applications to enhance code readability and reusability.
* We know that Node.js has built-in tools and how to use them if we need to, such as the fs library.
* We understand how and why to use the npm init command to create Node.js packages that are dependent on outside tools and libraries such as Inquirer.
* We can use new array methods with object destructuring and arrow function implicit returns to create succinct and readable code.
* We can identify where the asynchronous functionality can be cleaned up and how to turn callback functions into JavaScript Promise objects.
